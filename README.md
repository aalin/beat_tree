## BeatTree

Makes trees into beats for use in music.

    BeatTree.new([1])          # One whole note
    BeatTree.new([1, 1])       # Two half notes
    BeatTree.new([1, [1, 1]])  # One half note, followed by two quarters
    BeatTree.new([1, 1, 1])    # Triplets
    BeatTree.new([1, 1, 1, 1]) # Four quarters
                               # etc... You get it!
